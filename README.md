# SessionUnlocker

This is a small utility that responses to the System-Lock event and neutralizes it by raising the opposite Unlock event system-wide. It was created for Lync (Skype for Business) because it changes its status to _Away_ after locking the system with `Win+L`. If this tool is enabled Lync will stay `Available`.
